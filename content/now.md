#### Current Project
Right now I am devloping an internal tool with a coworker and using it as an opportunity to improve my skills with Python and to learn how to use git and GitHub in the context of team development. 
I am currently working through
A Cloud Guru's [Introduction to Python Scripting](https://acloudguru.com/course/introduction-to-python-scripting)
and the [Git Mindset](https://www.udemy.com/course/git-mindset/) course on Udemy to help with this.

#### Previous Project
I just wrapped up building the initial version
of this website with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
