title: "What I'm doing now"

#### Current Project
Right now I'm studying Python from several angles to slowly build fluency in the language. I'm working my way through a variety of Python courses I have access to and doing exercises along the way. You can track my progress on my [Python tag](/tags/python) and my [Python Playground repo](https://github.com/0xConnorRhodes/python-playground) on GitHub.

#### Previous Project
I just wrapped up learning git with Abhin Chhabra's [Git Mindset course](/blog/git-mindset-course).
