A Cloud Guru's [Introduction to Python Scripting](https://acloudguru.com/course/introduction-to-python-scripting) provides an introduction to the fundamentals of Python scripting including loops, conditionals, and functions. The course has a heavy emphasis on using the REPL to reverse engineer the instructor's example code that I really appreciated.

My biggest takeaway from the course was its ASCII art lab. This lab challenges the student to write a series of nested loops to draw a symmetrical shape in ASCII art. Check out the code I wrote for this assignment [here](https://github.com/0xConnorRhodes/python-playground/blob/main/introduction-to-python-scripting/assignments/1-ascii-diamond.py).

During this exercise, the instructor encourages the student to visualize how a loop will perform as they write their code. This assignment is very similar to one of the assignments in week 2 of Harvard University's [CS50 Introduction to Computer Science](/blog/cs50-intro-to-computer-science), and I found that working on one exercise reinforced the other.
