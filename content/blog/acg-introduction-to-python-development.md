### takeaways
- explanations are much more thorough from a data structure perspective. (eg, it's the first course that explained strings in terms of objects which helped me understand why you can call methods on them.
- I appreciate that the instructor will give opinions on how useful each thing you learn is (eg. the two most common uses for the modulus operator are x and y. It's not too common beyond that.) He gives context from industry experience.
