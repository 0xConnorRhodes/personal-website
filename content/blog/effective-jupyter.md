[Effective Jupyter](https://store.metasnake.com/effective-jupyter-basic) provides concise introduction to using Jupyter Notebooks to work with Python. IPython, the backend of Jupyter, provides an upgraded REPL that allows for easy experimentation with snippets of code. Jupyter builds on the IPython backend by providing a cell-based web interface to write, interpret, and reorder snippets of Python code. This course teaches you how to set up, interact with, and customize these tools.

I'm grateful for the easy introduction to Jupyter and IPython that this course provided me. These utilities are definitely going to be my preferred way to "think-out-loud" in Python going forward.
