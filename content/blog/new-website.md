I made a new website! This website will be a place for me to document the projects I work on and the things I learn. Some of the best career advice I've ever received is that an engineer should *always be building.* That's advice I've taken to heart. Over the past several years, I've learned a lot from out-of-the-way blogs written by engineers who [work with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu). I'd like to start doing the same as a way of giving back and helping others.

In the future of this website, you can expect
- Notes on my personal projects
- Reviews of training courses I complete
- Posts on certificate and skill milestones
- Notes on anything else I'm tinkering with or thinking about
