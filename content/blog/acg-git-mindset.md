[Git Quick Start](https://acloudguru.com/course/git-quick-start) provides a brief introduction to source-control using git on the command line. The course covers configuring git, working with repositories, merging and pushing changes, and working with git branches. This course was valuable to me because it provided the information to allow me to start using git to track my personal projects. Using git to track my personal code has allowed to learn many of git’s advanced features by doing. Since completing this course, I have begun tracking all the code for my personal projects in git.

Note: This course was previously completed on Linux Academy before they were acquired by A Cloud Guru. The certificate was generated at a later date in A Cloud Guru's web portal.
