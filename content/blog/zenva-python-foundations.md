[Python Foundations](https://academy.zenva.com/product/python-foundations/) from Zenva gives a brief overview of the building blocks of the Python programming language. The course covers setting up a Python environment, Python's basic data types, and creating functions.

The course is very brief, but provides a good introduction to key terms and concepts that will come up again in later courses. I used this course to create a structured heirarchy of Python notes that I can add to and refactor as I move on to more intermediate level courses.
